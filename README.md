# github app

This is my first project using react and hooks together, there were not two repositories (back and front) because it is something initial in some future project I will do something complete!

> enjoy that work!

# how to put to work?

### run this

`$ npm install` and `$ npm init`

### and lastly this...

`$ npm start`

# how it works (with images)

Access the "readme" folder inside it you follow this order below and you will understand how the application works:

- inicial.png
- pesquisa.png
- final1.png
- final2.png

In order, we open the application and can search anybody for the user here on github, they will bring their profile picture, their repositories and the number of repositories (of the favorites too!), Their followers and who you follow. So far not I have future ideas but if I think I will return to this project.

> thanks for visiting my repository!
